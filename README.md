# DMX Little Helpers

A plugin development helper comprised of the following functionalities. It should be named `dmx-utils` but the code does not do justice to the concept of a utility in terms of its robustness and the API does not in terms of its clarity.

To see if it might be of use to you find the API described in [HelperService.java](https://git.dmx.systems/dmx-plugins/dmx-littlehelpers/-/blob/master/src/main/java/systems/dmx/littlehelpers/HelperService.java).

Time Search API (HTTP):

- `/timeindex/{time_value}/{since}/{to}` (builds Index for visually supporting time-queries)
- `/by_time/{time_value}/{since}/{to}` (queries `Note`, `File`, `Folder`, `Person`, `Organization` and `Bookmark` topics)

Parameter `time_value` can be either `created` or `modified`.

Results of this API are each enriched about an icon path and their `created` and `modified` timestamps.

Topic search API (delivering a list of `SearchResult`):

- `/suggest/topics/{input}` (queries `Note Title`, `Topicmaps Name` and `Username`)
- `/suggest/topics/{input}/{typeUri}`
 
`Search Result` of this endpoint _are_ each enriched about their `creator (username)` and `workspace` info.

Topicmaps utilities:

- `getTopicmapsByMaptype`

Datetime utilities:

- `setDateTopic(ChildTopicsModel cm, Date date, String assocTypeUri)`

Topic Type utilities:

- `getTopicTypesConfiguredForCreateMenu`

Workspace utilities:

- `getFirstWorkspaceByName`

Sorting utilities:

- `getTopicListSortedByCreationTime`
- `getTopicListSortedByModificationTime`
- `sortCompareToBySimpleValue`
- `sortCompareToByChildTypeValue`
